# make-your-game

## Objectives
This project aims to implement a game scoreboard system along with a Go API service that enables the storage and retrieval of game data in JSON format. Additionally, the project involves creating a challenging single-player game using JavaScript without the use of frameworks or canvas, focusing on achieving a smooth animation experience at 60 FPS.

## Game Features
- The game runs at a consistent 60 FPS with no frame drops.
- The use of RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.
- A pause menu with options to Continue and Restart.
- A scoreboard displaying metrics like Countdown clock, Score, and Lives.

For example:

```console
Congrats O.J, you are in the top 6%, on the 2nd position.

Rank| Name | Score  | time
---------------------------
1st | Kave | 233254 | 12:01
2nd | A.J. | 222555 | 03:00
3rd | O.J. | 14356  | 05:40
4th | -.-  | 13663  | 02:34
5th | iris | 2354   | 00:40
